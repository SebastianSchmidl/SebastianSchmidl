### Hi there, I'm Sebastian Schmidl 👋

I'm a software engineer and PhD student at the [chair for Information Systems](https://hpi.de/naumann/home.html) ([:computer:](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems)) at [Hasso Plattner Institut for Digital Engineering (HPI)](https://hpi.de/en/index.html).
Currently, I'm working in the distributed computing research group, where we investigate **computationally complex problems** and how they can be solved in **distributed environments**.

**🔭 Research Interests**

- Scalable and reactive systems, especially using **actor programming** concepts
- Time series anomaly detection
- Distributed computing
- Data profiling

**💻 Current open-source activity**

- Maintainer @ [TimeEval](https://github.com/TimeEval/timeeval) - An Evaluation Tool for Anomaly Detection Algorithms on Time Series
- Core developer @ [aeon](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon) - A toolkit for conducting machine learning tasks with time series data
